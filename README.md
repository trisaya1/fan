# Arduino Remote-Controlled Fan with Temperature Sensor
This project is an embedded system that controls a fan based on temperature input from a DHT11 sensor, with manual override via an IR remote. It demonstrates real-world applications of sensor intergation, control logic, and user interaction designed with a top-down modular approach and implemented bottom up.
